# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Purpost of this project:
This project is about using JavaScript, the D3 library, Leaflet, and Mapbox to create interactive maps. 

We use JavaScript and the D3 library to read data from the source URL, then use Leaflet to add markers, circles, lines, or polygons on the map, various layers of the map, adding popups to show the details of the event and the location.

Also with this project, we had hands-on experience with GitHub's branch feature! To introduce the benefits of the branch, how to merge with the main branch, and what the process could be like in the future.

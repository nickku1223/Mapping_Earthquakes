# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Purpost of this project:
This project is about to use JavaScript, D3 library, Leaflet and Mapbox to create interactive maps. 

We use JavaScript and the D3 library to read data from the source URL, then use Leaflet to add markers, circle, lines or polygons on the map, various layers of map, adding popups to show the details of the event and the location.

Also with this project, we had hand-on experience with GitHub's branch feature! To introduce the benefits of branch, how to merge to the main branch, and how the process could be like in the future.
